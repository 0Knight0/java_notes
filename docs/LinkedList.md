# LinkedList and the List Interface

Declaring a LinkedList. Use non-primitive type in the declaration,
i.e. wrapper classes, this is typical of Template Classes, valid
for the other Collections as well. If you need to remove items from the
middle of the start of a list, or anywhere rather than the absolute end,
you'd need to use a LinkedList.

```java
List<Integer> linkedList = new LinkedList<Integer>();
```

## Import statements

To Import the following collections:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;
```
